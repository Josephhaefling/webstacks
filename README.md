## Project Overview
The primary emphasis of this project was to create a small Gatsby landing page that sources content from
Contentful.

## Challenges
- The background image
  - I was unable to make the background image responsive. 
  - I was unable to darken the image or add a gradient to the image. 
- Accessing the body tag
  - I was unable to access the body tag in the application which made some of the styling difficult. 
- I ran into some issues deploying the application, but I was able to resolve those problems with a little help from Google.
